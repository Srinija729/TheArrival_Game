# TheArrival_Game

# Game Concept
The game is based on concepts picked up from the movie Arrival. The players in this game are linguists hired by the Government to help decode the message given to us (humanity) by the aliens. While decoding itself maybe be one challenge, the real challenge is to race against other players and tackle the unforeseen hurdles. The rules are created based on events of the movie and hence, as the game progresses, the movie plot is explained.
 
# Description
In 12 parts of the world, alien spaceships have appeared. A Linguist was hired by the Government to decode the language of the aliens. While they are trying to crack the language/ decode the code, they are faced with challenges. An example of it could be when the Government orders a strike against the aliens and that puts pressure on the linguist to decode the message much faster in order to prevent the war. As the linguist dwells deeper into understanding the code, their perception of time changes. Language is the key to how we understand things. When the linguist begins to grasp the concept of the alien language, they begin to perceive time as a non-linear entity.
This game mainly focuses on the ‘decoding’ aspect of the movie. The rules - power-ups and hurdles are all based on how the storyline of the movie proceeds.

#Concept Note
The primary objective behind this game is to narrate the story/plot of the chosen movie (Arrival). The movie had various concepts that could be explored, but we chose to explore the concepts of language, decoding, nonlinear time perception and determinism and freewill. The game rules and their resulting actions are based on events that occur in the movie.

#Gameplay Instructions
- The game is played between 3 players. 2 players (P1 and P2) who are the linguists and one player (A) who is the alien (code-maker)
- Each player is provided a sheet of paper with a table pre-drawn.
- First, the decided player ‘A’ will choose a pattern of 5 consisting of the symbols provided (out of 8 that are provided) and note it down.
- Any one symbol can be repeated once
- This pattern of 5 will be set aside and will act as the code that is to be cracked for the game.
- To guess the code, initially the number ofchances are 10. Number of chances vary as the game progresses (will be stated later).
 - Both players, ‘P1’ and ‘P2’ will start by guessing what the code is by placing a pattern of 5 symbols which they think is right. A timer for 30 seconds will be set.
- As soon as the timer stops, ‘P1’ and ‘P2’ will have to show their sheet to ‘A’.
- If all five blanks are filled, then ‘A’ will evaluate the answer. Otherwise, if all five blanks are not filled, then that player lose their chance
- ‘A’ will mark the boxes on player’s sheet as: (while comparing to the original 5-set set aside)
- If the right symbol is placed in the right blank, then ‘A’ will mark it with a circle drawn around the symbol
- If the right symbol is used but placed in the wrong blank, then ‘A’ will mark it with a line drawn below that symbol
- If a wrong symbol is used, A will not mark it at all. 
- - If in a round, if a ‘P1’ or ‘P2’ guess two consecutive blanks correctly, then a third blank answer is revealed to them. This is a power-up/ bonus.
- Following this, that player must guess the final two blanks within the next three chances or they will be eliminated.
- Or, the player can refuse the clue and continue with the game with the rest of their chances.
- If ‘P1’ or ‘P2’ get only one blank correct and remain in the same condition for 2 consecutive rounds, then their remaining number of chances to guess are five or till they finish 10 chances in total (whichever first)
- If ‘P1’ or ‘P2’ guess three blanks correctly within the first four chances, not necessarily consecutive, then their remaining number of chances become three. This is a power-down/ hurdle.
